# Image-Denoising-Segmentation
• Implementing modern image denoising algorithms like non-local mean (NLM), bilateral filtering and total variation (TV).

• applying simple and advanced segmentation algorithms like K-means, fuzzy c-means
(FCM), adaptive regularized kernel-based FCM (ARKFCM), Gaussian mixture model
(GMM), basic snake and gradient vector flow(GVF) on MRI image from patient suffering a tumor
